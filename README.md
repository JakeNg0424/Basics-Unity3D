# Basics-Unity3D
Install Unity, and become familiar with...

- Scripts and MonoBehaviors
- Game Objects and Scenes
- Input handling
- Transform manipulation


Repository contains the Unity project that runs + video of the project being played.


Dynamically manipulate the position, rotation, and scale of an object in the scene.
You can modify these values in any way you like, as long as they visibly change while the game is running.

>For example, you could create a cube, and have it spin in circles while scaling down and moving up into the sky.


Dynamically manipulate the color of an object.
Similarly to the last feature, you can modify the color however you like, as long as it visible changes while the game is running.

>For example, the object could get darker over time.
 

Save and load some object state
Save and load at least some of the object's state in a way that survives exiting and restarting the game.

>e.g. if the object is rotating, you could remember where the object was rotated to when exiting and reload it when the game starts. You could also have a UI that you have to click to save/load instead of making it automatic if you prefer, as long as you can exit the game, reenter it, and get back the state again.


A unique manipulation:
Pressing the 'Space' bar will make the Cube disappear
